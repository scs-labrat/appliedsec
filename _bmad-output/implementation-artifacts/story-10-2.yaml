summary: |
  BatchScheduler with dual-trigger submission: count threshold (50 tasks)
  or time threshold (6 hours), whichever fires first. enqueue()/enqueue_many()
  accumulate tasks, should_flush() checks triggers, flush() submits and
  clears queue. tick() is the main loop entry point. poll_active_jobs()
  checks submitted/in_progress jobs. get_completed_jobs() returns jobs
  needing result processing. Empty queue never flushes.
tests: 20 passed
